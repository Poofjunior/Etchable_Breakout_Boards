# DS3234 Etchable Breakout Board

[The mirrored brd file transferred to vinyl](images/toner.jpg)

## Basic Info  
  This board is a simple breakout board for the DS3234 Real Time Clock chip,
heavily inspired by the breakout board provided by Sparkfun.
Note that these Eagle files require the Sparkfun Component Library.

The DS3234 is a high-accuracy RTC with an SPI interface and built-in backup 
battery circuitry.  With this breakout board, there's not reason not to upgrade
 from your DS1307 RTC.

Be careful when etching!
