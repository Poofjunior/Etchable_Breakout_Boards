# DS3234 Etchable Breakout Board

## Basic Info  
  This board is a simple breakout board for the DS3234 Real Time Clock chip.

The DS3234 is a high-accuracy RTC with an SPI interface and built-in backup 
battery circuitry.  With this breakout board, there's not reason not to upgrade
 from your DS1307 RTC.

Be careful when etching!
